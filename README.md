Sleepnet
========

Sleepnet is a streaming radio station I built that plays Creative Commons licensed music, for free, 24/7. The name comes from SleepNet, a small intranet and domain that I built beneath my bed at my parent's house. SleepNet was built to serve pirated music and movies throughout the house and extended internet, until a rogue feline took out the cabling.
